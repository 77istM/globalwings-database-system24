# GlobalWings Charter Database System

A concise relational database system designed for GlobalWings Charter Ltd as part of the CI5325 Data Modelling coursework at Kingston University London. This project demonstrates complete database development from conceptual modelling to SQL implementation and testing.

## 🚀 Overview
GlobalWings operates passenger and cargo aircraft across Europe. The company requires a structured database to manage clients, bookings, aircraft, crew details, licences, medical/drug tests, and crew assignments. This system replaces their spreadsheet-based workflow.

## 🧩 Key Components
- **ER Diagram**: Full UML-based conceptual model defining entities, relationships, cardinalities and assumptions.
- **Data Dictionary**: Detailed table definitions including data types and constraints.
- **Relational Schema**: Oracle SQL tables with PKs, FKs, UNIQUE and CHECK constraints.
- **Data Population**: Sample data inserted across all major tables.
